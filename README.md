# UpdatedPortfolio
https://mjallah.github.io/UpdatedPortfolio/

For this updated portfolio, I used HTML and CSS. It was a pretty simple assignment considering most of it was done from a previous homework assignment.

For the Updated portfolio, it allows anyone viewing the website to see a little bit about me. Place their contact info, as well as see some of the projects I've completed.
